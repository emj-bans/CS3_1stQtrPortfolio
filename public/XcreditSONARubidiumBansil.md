# Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.
## by Emmanuel Jr. R. Bansil of 9 - Rubidium
### Keypoints
3 keypoints from the SONA 2025 that I found interesting are:
* The efforts in expanding the country's clean energy sources,
* The government investing in the Filipino people's education, and
* The efforts in offering free health check-ups and lab tests
1 thing I found weird is:
* Why is that the government is still investing in Philhealth when there have been controversial events that happened related to Philhealth
### Reflection
In SONA, I found come topics that caught my eye. These were **education**, **energy use**, and **electricity**. These paragraphs will only focus on *these three topics* but I think that there are also other things that the president has stated in SONA that deserves attention.  I like that the government is also prioritizing these for the *benefit of the Filipino people*. Seeing that the government has made efforts in helping student in their **education** and in their **health**, especially *mental health*, feels good because this means that *school will feel lighter*.

In **electricity and energy use**, I like studying these topics so seeing that electricity will be more *inclusive* also feels good. Advocating for *renewable energy options* also feels like a good decision made. Focusing on education, energy, and electricity allows the government to have a more *inclusive and sustainable future* for the nation. I think these decisions will be able to *enhance the life of Filipinos* and *helping in long-term national growth*.
### One phrase
A phrase I'll give about the SONA is this: 'que sera, sera."
