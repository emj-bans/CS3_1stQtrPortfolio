# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.

1. **While and do...while** - At first, I didn't understand how to use the `while` and `do...while` statements because they looked weird at first. Now, since we've tackled it, I now know that it's easy to use these loops because a condition was just needed in this syntax. Also, I now know the difference between the two!
2. **Basic HTML tags** - This one was just easy to do when I was studying it because it is literally just `<>` and `</>`. It's very easy to understand!
3. **Making Custom Functions in JS** - This was easy to understand also because the concept was also just as easy! The ide is that you're just grouping them so that whenever you need that specificc code, you just have to call it!
4. **Variable Declaration** - This one was also easy and I now know it very well, because you are just differentiating `let`, `var`, and `const`. The only difference is in their functions.
5. **Event handling** - Event handling was also something I now know very well because it also has a basic concept. You just put the event handler inside the HTML tag and it will do it.

# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  

1. **For loops** - I understand how for loops generally work, but I can sometimes get confused when actually writing the initialization, condition, and increment properly. I also confuse myself about when to use a for loop over a while loop.
2. **Number properties** - I sometimes forget which number property to use, such as integers, floats, or decimals, when doing math problems in programming, which leads to a lack of confidence in which will give the correct answer.
3. **Generating and putting output from a JS function to an HTML element** - Just like for loops, I know how this generally works also, but sometimes I get confused and forget the syntax for `document.getElementById("id").innerHTML` especially. I also sometimes forget the difference between `document.write()` and `document.getElementById("id").innerHTML`.
4. **When and How to Reference JS and CSS files in HTML** - I know JS and CSS files can be linked to HTML, but I can forget where and how to correctly write them. Sometimes I end up putting the script tag in the wrong place, or I forget which one to link in the  (CSS) or the bottom of the  (JS).
5. **Forgetting Which CSS Syntaxes to Use** - I understand the reason for CSS, but I often forget to follow the correct syntax. For example, I sometimes forget if I need a semicolon or how to create a selector properly. This is why my CSS does not function as intended.

# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.

1. To improve my skills with for loops, I plan to practice writing simple programs that make use of for loops. I will practice printing numbers, adding values in an array, etc. I will review the examples regarding properties of numbers and will practice solving small math problems involving each type of number in JavaScript so that I can see how each type of number works. For remembering var, let, and const, I will create a comparison chart and redirect my simple programs with each one. For referencing JS and CSS files, I will practice linking to JS and CSS files in my small projects and check for examples of the proper syntax in online tutorials. Lastly, for CSS syntax, I will create a list of the most common CSS properties I write down and then practice the CSS properties by designing simple webpages.
