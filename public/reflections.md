# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. **While and do...while** - The while and do...while loops are utilized for occasions when you want to repeat some piece of code until some condition is no longer true. While loops test the condition first before running the code, which means if the condition is false, it may not run at all. Do...while loops, on the other hand, run the code at least once and check afterwards whether or not to keep running it. These are useful if you don't know for sure how many times you want to repeat the code..
2. **Basic HTML tags** - Another topic is the basic HTML tags. The basic units of a webpage are HTML tags.  They are used to create links, images, paragraphs, and titles.  Like, `<p>` creates a paragraph, `<h1>` creates a large heading, and `<img>` adds an image to the page.  A webpage without HTML tags would simply appear to be unstructured plain text.
3. **Making Custom Functions in JS** - One more topic is the making of custom functions in JS. A custom function is like making your own command. Simply calling the function's name allows you to use it repeatedly after you've written it once. Functions contribute to the code's clarity and cleanliness.
4. **Generating and putting output from a JS function to an HTML element** - Another topic is generating and putting output from a JS function to an HTML element. JavaScript can be used to display results or answers directly on a webpage. Using `document.write()` is one method, but the more effective method is to use `document.getElementById("id").innerHTML`, which allows us to place the result inside a `<p>` tag or something similar. When we want the page to change without reloading, this is really helpful.
5. **Lastly, one topic I know very well is event handling.** An event handler allows some sort of action to occur on the web page when we engage in an activity like clicking a button or moving our mouse. For example, if I put an onclick in a button tag, I can run a function whenever I click it. Event handlers make web pages so much more interactive and not simply static text.
# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
1. **For loops** - I understand how for loops generally work, but I can sometimes get confused when actually writing the initialization, condition, and increment properly. I also confuse myself about when to use a for loop over a while loop.
2. **Number properties** - I sometimes forget which number property to use, such as integers, floats, or decimals, when doing math problems in programming, which leads to a lack of confidence in which will give the correct answer.
3. **Variable Declaration** - I know variable declaration keywords are different, but I sometimes forget what makes them different. For instance, I forget when to use let instead of const, or that using var is not always a smart idea.
4. **When and How to Reference JS and CSS files in HTML** - I know JS and CSS files can be linked to HTML, but I can forget where and how to correctly write them. Sometimes I end up putting the script tag in the wrong place, or I forget which one to link in the  (CSS) or the bottom of the  (JS).
5. **Forgetting Which CSS Syntaxes to Use** - I understand the reason for CSS, but I often forget to follow the correct syntax. For example, I sometimes forget if I need a semicolon or how to create a selector properly. This is why my CSS does not function as intended.
# Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
1. To improve my skills with for loops, I plan to practice writing simple programs that make use of for loops. I will practice printing numbers, adding values in an array, etc. I will review the examples regarding properties of numbers and will practice solving small math problems involving each type of number in JavaScript so that I can see how each type of number works. For remembering var, let, and const, I will create a comparison chart and redirect my simple programs with each one. For referencing JS and CSS files, I will practice linking to JS and CSS files in my small projects and check for examples of the proper syntax in online tutorials. Lastly, for CSS syntax, I will create a list of the most common CSS properties I write down and then practice the CSS properties by designing simple webpages.
