# List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.
1. First topic that I learned and know very well is for loops! A for loop is when you want to get the computer to repeat something multiple times without having to type the same code a lot of times. It has three components: where the counter begins, when it should end, and how it modifies. Like, if I want to print numbers between 1 and 10, I can use a for loop rather than typing ten lines of code. This is quicker and simpler programming.
2. Another topic is the basic HTML tags. The basic units of a webpage are HTML tags.  They are used to create links, images, paragraphs, and titles.  Like, `<p>` creates a paragraph, `<h1>` creates a large heading, and `<img>` adds an image to the page.  A webpage without HTML tags would simply appear to be unstructured plain text.
3. One more topic is the making of custom functions in JS. A custom function is like making your own command. Simply calling the function's name allows you to use it repeatedly after you've written it once. Functions contribute to the code's clarity and cleanliness.
4. Another topic is generating and putting output from a JS function to an HTML element. JavaScript can be used to display results or answers directly on a webpage. Using `document.write()` is one method, but the more effective method is to use `document.getElementById("id").innerHTML`, which allows us to place the result inside a `<p>` tag or something similar. When we want the page to change without reloading, this is really helpful.
5. Lastly, one topic I know very well is event handling. An event handler allows some sort of action to occur on the web page when we engage in an activity like clicking a button or moving our mouse. For example, if I put an onclick in a button tag, I can run a function whenever I click it. Event handlers make web pages so much more interactive and not simply static text.
# List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.
